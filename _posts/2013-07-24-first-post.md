I had a some trouble getting pagination to work with Jekyll.

I followed the guide in the [documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/).  But it wouldn't work.

I thought maybe my ````jekyll server \-\-watch```` command wasn't picking up the changes to \_config.yml.  So I tried ````jekyll build````  Still nothing.  I tried ````jekyll````  Then ````jekyll server --watch````  And now it works.

Maybe I'm losing my mind.
